                                    When you call or email King&rsquo;s Green Cleaning for an estimate you will be put in contact with our experienced schedulers. We can schedule a home visit within 24 hours to give you a more accurate estimate for your cleaning. We can also give you an estimate over the phone but it will be a broader range. We will need to know some information about your space like square footage, number of rooms and pets. We can usually book a cleaning within the next week.&nbsp; If you have a last minute cleaning, don&rsquo;t hesitate to call. We can work with you to get you on the schedule as soon as possible.

                                    You do not have to be home when we come to clean your home. We will have already made arrangements with you on how our cleaning team is to enter your home so there is no need for you to be there. Your safety and security is of great importance to us. We go to great lengths to keep all information and keys safe and protected.

                                    One of the reasons we started cleaning green was to have a safer home environment for our pets. We are definitely pet friendly, however, if your pet is not &ldquo;stranger&rdquo; friendly, we ask that you have them put up in a safe area. Your pet&rsquo;s safety is just as important to us as our own. If your pet is friendly and allowed to be out in the home, please let us know where you keep the treats. With your permission, we would love to show them some love. Due to health hazards our cleaning crews WILL NOT pick up or clean up any pet stains left by urine or feces. Please let our scheduler know if there are any special accommodations that need to be made on behalf of your pet.

                                    Yes. If you are already a King&rsquo;s Green Cleaning client and you refer us a friend who then books an initial and recurring cleaning you will receive $50 dollars off a cleaning service.

                                    Our cleaning teams have 2-3 uniformed employees per team with a supervisor on site for any questions, help and quality control. It is important to us that you receive a consistent clean tailored to your expectations. We ensure this by sending the same supervisor to your home every time it is cleaned.

                                    You can pay with cash or check at the time of your cleaning. If you prefer to pay with a credit card, one must be put on file through our office. The crew that is sent to clean your home will not be able to take a credit card payment. Commercial clients can also keep a credit card on file through our office or can be invoiced monthly. Payment is due upon receipt of the invoice.

                                    King&rsquo;s Green Cleaning is a family owned business and we understand  life gets hectic and plans can change at the last minute. Should you need to cancel your cleaning service, we would appreciate a 24-hour notice if possible. A $25 cancellation fee will be charge if there is a lock out, which is when our crew arrives at scheduled time and is unable to access the property within 15 minutes of arrival. A fee will also be charged if a client is habitually canceling within the allotted 24-hour cancellation period prior to a cleaning.

Have the sink clear of dirty dishes. If we are changing your bed sheets, we ask that the new sheets be laid out and the washer/dryer be empty so we can start a load of the dirty linens. Any other special request or instructions will be discussed with the scheduler so they can relate your wishes to the cleaning team.
